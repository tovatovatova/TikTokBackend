Youth Safety and Well-Being
Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) refers to any sexualized material of a young person that is shared or created by anyone, including self-generated CSAM. It includes implied or clearly visible sexual activities and sexual assault of young people, as well as the sexualization or fetishization of their body.
Significant body exposure includes showing part of the pubic area and buttocks, or implied nudity, such as using an object to cover nude genitalia. For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear.
Moderate body exposure includes showing the visible outline of covered genitalia, nipples through clothing, and exposed skin near an intimate body part, such as a part of a breast and the upper part of the thigh.
Seductive performances involve certain body movements that are intended to be sexually arousing, such as undressing (stripteases), pelvic thrusting, breast shaking, and fondling.
Sexualized posing is behavior with the intent to sexually arouse, through a combination of: (1) emphasizing intimate body parts, such as by zooming in on genitals, or using hands to frame breasts; and (2) overt sexual expressions, including suggestive captions (such as “do you like what you see?”).
Allusion to sexual activity is behavior with the intent to call to mind sexual activity, including imitating sexual acts (such as licking a phallic-shaped object), sounds (such as moaning), and facial expressions (such as an “O” face to mimic an orgasm).

Hate Speech and Hateful Behaviors
Hateful ideologies are systems of beliefs that exclude, oppress, or otherwise discriminate against individuals based on their protected attributes, such as racial supremacy, misogyny, anti-LGBTQIA+, and antisemitism.
Protected attributes are personal characteristics that we are born with, are immutable, or cannot change without severe psychological harm, and which may result in disproportionate stigmatization. In addition, we also provide some protections related to age, and may consider other protected attributes when we have additional context, such as specific regional information provided to us by a local non-governmental organization (NGO). The attributes above are informed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international conventions.

Violent and Hateful Organizations and Individuals
We want our creators to share what inspires them, but there is no place on our platform for those dedicated to spreading beliefs or propaganda that encourage violence or hate. We do not allow the presence of violent and hateful organizations or individuals on our platform. These actors include violent extremists, violent criminal organizations, violent political organizations, hateful organizations, and individual perpetrators of mass violence. If we become aware that any such actor may be on our platform, we will conduct a thorough review – including off-platform behavior – which may result in an account ban.
Often the ideas of these actors are amplified by others. We do not allow anyone to promote or materially support violent or hateful actors. Content that may appear neutral, such as referencing a quote from a hateful organization, must make clear that there is no intent to promote it. We make limited allowances for people to discuss violent political organizations, but only if: (1) their causes are recognized as legitimate under international legal frameworks, (2) they do not primarily target civilians, and (3) the content does not mention violence.
Violent extremists are non-state groups, including those designated by the United Nations, that threaten or use violence against civilians for political, religious, ethnic, or ideological reasons.
Criminal organizations are transnational, national, or local groups that commit serious crimes, including violence, trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, and cybercrime.
Violent political organizations are non-state groups that commit violent acts that primarily target non-civilians and are acting legitimately under a right of self determination according to international law, such as the United Nations Charter, a United Nations resolution, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the international Court of Justice (ICJ).
Hateful organizations are groups who target people based on protected attributes, including inciting hate, dehumanizing individuals or groups, and promoting hateful ideologies.
NOT allowed
•	Accounts operated by organizations or individuals that promote violence or hateful ideologies on or off-platform
•	Promoting or materially supporting a violent or hateful organization, including any praise or celebration, or the provision of goods or services

Allowed
•	Discussing a violent political organization (as long as there is no mention of violence)

Youth Exploitation and Abuse
TikTok is a place for exploration and learning. Allowing young people to do so safely during their unique phase of development is our priority. We do not allow youth exploitation and abuse, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), nudity, grooming, sextortion, solicitation, pedophilia, and physical or psychological abuse of young people. This includes content that is real, fictional, digitally created, and shown in fine art or objects.
Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) refers to any sexualized material of a young person that is shared or created by anyone, including self-generated CSAM. It includes implied or clearly visible sexual activities and sexual assault of young people, as well as the sexualization or fetishization of their body or body parts.
Grooming is when an adult becomes friendly or otherwise builds a trusting relationship with a young person for the purpose of sexual exploitation or abuse.
Sextortion is a threat to share nude, intimate, or sexually explicit content without consent, usually to get money, sexual acts, or more nude, intimate, or sexually explicit content.
NOT allowed
•	Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and youth nudity
•	Promoting youth sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, and sexual fetishism

Sexual Exploitation and Gender-Based Violence
We are committed to providing a space that embraces gender equity, supports healthy relationships, and respects intimate privacy. Undermining these values can cause trauma and may lead to physical and psychological harm. We do not allow sexual exploitation or gender-based violence, including non-consensual sexual acts, image-based sexual abuse, sextortion, physical abuse, and sexual harassment.
Non-consensual sexual acts refer to any sexual contact that happens without the consent of everyone involved in the activity.
Image-based sexual abuse is the creation, manufacture, or distribution of nude, partially nude, or sexually explicit content without the consent of the person in the content, for the purpose of sexualizing their body, or portraying them in a sexual manner.
Sextortion is a threat to share nude, intimate, or sexually explicit content without consent, usually to get money, sexual acts, or more nude, intimate, or sexually explicit content.

Human Exploitation

We are committed to upholding individual human dignity and ensuring our platform is not used to take advantage of vulnerable people. We do not allow human exploitation, including trafficking and smuggling. We understand how important it is for survivors of human exploitation to share their stories, and for migrants and refugees to be able to document their journeys, so we provide a space to do so.
Human trafficking involves earning a profit by exploiting others through the use of fraud, force, or coercion. Considered a form of modern slavery, it can include sex, labor, youth, or organ trafficking, forced marriage, exploitative begging, and the recruitment of youth soldiers.
Human smuggling involves earning a profit by helping a person to illegally enter another country. It can include providing transportation, consultation, identity, and travel document fraud.
NOT allowed
•	Facilitating or promoting human trafficking and human smuggling activities
•	Requesting support for being smuggled illegally into a different country
Allowed

•	Survivors sharing their own experiences of human exploitation
•	Educational and documentary content related to the harms of human exploitation
Harassment and Bullying

We welcome the respectful expression of different viewpoints but not toxicity or trolling. We want to ensure that anyone can share their voice without the fear of being degraded or bullied. We do not allow language or behavior that harasses, humiliates, threatens, or doxxes anyone. This also includes responding to such acts with retaliatory harassment (but excludes non-harassing counter speech).
We allow some critical comments of public figures, understanding that they are in a position of public attention and have ways to counter negative speech, and that the critique may be in the public interest to view. However, we still remove content that violates other policies (such as threats, hate speech, and sexual exploitation), as well as serious forms of harassment (such as doxxing and expressing a desire for someone to experience serious physical harm).
Doxxing involves publishing personal information about someone online with a malicious intent. We recognize intent can be subjective, so we use objective indicators to help us understand it, such as captions and hashtags.
Public figures are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, and celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.
NOT allowed
•	Degrading someone or expressing disgust on the basis of their personal characteristics or circumstances, such as their physical appearance, intellect, personality traits, and hygiene
•	Showing someone being physically bullied by another person or group

Dangerous Activities and Challenges
We welcome when our community collectively participates in fun and creative trends. Most activities or challenges are appropriate for everyone and bring people together, but some carry a risk of significant injury. We do not allow showing or promoting dangerous activities and challenges. This includes dares, games, tricks, inappropriate use of dangerous tools, eating substances that are harmful to one’s health, or similar activities that may lead to significant physical harm.
Content is age-restricted if it shows activities that are likely to be imitated and may lead to any physical harm. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves activities that are likely to lead to moderate physical harm, or includes professionals who are performing extreme sports and stunts that may endanger others.
Dangerous activities and challenges include dares, games, tricks, and other acts performed by non-professionals that carry inherent or known risks and which may result in significant physical harm.
Significant physical harm typically requires professional medical treatment and creates a risk of temporary or permanent disability or disfigurement. This includes dislocated or broken bones, poisoning, loss of consciousness, serious burns, electrocution, concussion, and choking.
Moderate physical harm is unlikely to require professional medical treatment and does not create a risk of disability or disfigurement. This includes small cuts with minimal blood loss and minor bruising on the body.

Sexual Activity and Services
TikTok is a place where people can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be appropriate for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation. We do not allow sexual activity or services. This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content.
Sexual activity includes sex, sexual arousal, and fetish and kink behavior.
Fetish and kink behavior includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).
Reproductive health refers to physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.
Sex education refers to a broad variety of topics related to sex, sexuality, sexual health, and relationships.
NOT allowed

•	Reproductive health and sex education content, such as the use of birth control and abortion discussed in an medical way
Nudity and Body Exposure
We celebrate all shapes and sizes and want people to feel comfortable in how they present themselves and their bodies. We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural norms about nudity. We do not allow nudity, including uncovered genitals and buttocks, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls. Sheer and partially see-through clothing is not considered covered. We allow regional exceptions for showing nipples and areolas in limited situations, such as medical treatment, educational purposes, or as a part of culturally accepted practices.
Not all young people have the developmental maturity to respond to unwanted physical attention and uninvited sexualization, which may lead to psychological or physical harm. We do not allow significant body exposure of young people.
Content is age-restricted if it shows significant body exposure of an adult. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows moderate body exposure of a young person, or significant body exposure of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as common cultural practices.
Nudity is showing intimate body parts that prevailing cultural norms indicate should be fully covered. This currently includes bare genitals and buttocks of anyone, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls. It does not apply to nipples and areolas of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that there are individuals who do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. We start by looking at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, and bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.
Significant body exposure includes showing part of the pubic area and buttocks, or implied nudity, such as using an object to cover nude genitalia. For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear.
Moderate body exposure includes showing the visible outline of covered genitalia, nipples through clothing, and exposed skin near an intimate body part, such as a part of a breast and the upper part of the thigh.
NOT allowed
•	Nudity of adults, including photography and digitally created images such as manga and anime
•	Nudity of young people, including visual fine art, objects, photography, and digitally created images such as manga and anime (learn more about CSAM in Youth Exploitation)

•	Areolas and nipples of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary
•	Body exposure that appears in culturally expected contexts, such as athletes wearing sports apparel and swimsuits at a beach or festival
Sexually Suggestive Content
We welcome performances and dances where people can creatively express themselves, celebrate their culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. We do not allow seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by young people, or the use of sexually explicit narratives by anyone. We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.
Content is age-restricted if it shows seductive performances or sexualized posing by adults, or allusions to sexual activity by adults. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows sex products or intends to sexually arouse (such as intimate kissing, sexualized posing, and seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by adults).
Intent is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators such as captions, hashtags, bio, and sounds. We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which further informs our assessment.
Seductive performances involve certain body movements that are intended to be sexually arousing, such as undressing (stripteases), pelvic thrusting, breast shaking, and fondling.
Sexualized posing is behavior with the intent to sexually arouse, through a combination of: (1) emphasizing intimate body parts, such as by zooming in on genitals, or using hands to frame breasts; and (2) overt sexual expressions, including suggestive captions (such as “do you like what you see?”).
Allusion to sexual activity is behavior with the intent to call to mind sexual activity, including imitating sexual acts (such as licking a phallic-shaped object), sounds (such as moaning), and facial expressions (such as an “O” face to mimic an orgasm).

Shocking and Graphic Content
Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.
Content is age-restricted if it shows human or animal blood. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional violence, blood, potentially distressing or mildly graphic material, animal genitalia or sexual activity between animals.

Misinformation
We do not allow inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent. Significant harm includes physical, psychological, or societal harm, and property damage.
Misinformation includes inaccurate, misleading, or false content.
Significant harm includes severe forms of:
•	Physical injury and illness, including death
•	Psychological trauma
•	Large-scale property damage
•	Societal harm, including undermining fundamental social processes or institutions, such as democratic elections, and processes that maintain public health and public safety
Conspiracy theories are beliefs about unexplained events or involve rejecting generally accepted explanations for events and suggesting they were carried out by covert or powerful groups.
NOT allowed
•	Misinformation that poses a risk to public safety or may induce panic about a crisis event or emergency, including using historical footage of a previous attack as if it were current, or incorrectly claiming a basic necessity (such as food or water) is no longer available in a particular location
•	Medical misinformation, such as misleading statements about vaccines, inaccurate medical advice that discourages people from getting appropriate medical care for a life-threatening disease, and other misinformation that poses a risk to public health

Civic and Election Integrity
Elections are important moments of community conversation and promote the values of an open society. We try to balance enabling topical discussions, while also being a platform that brings us together and does not divide us. We do not allow paid political promotion, political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others). Our political ads policy includes both traditional paid ads and creators receiving compensation to support or oppose a candidate for office.
We want to enable the informed exchange of civic ideas in a way that fosters productive dialogue. We do not allow misinformation about civic and electoral processes, regardless of intent. This includes misinformation about how to vote, registering to vote, eligibility requirements of candidates, the processes to count ballots and certify elections, and the final outcome of an election.
Misinformation includes inaccurate, misleading, or false content.
NOT allowed
Election misinformation, including the following:
•	How, when, and where to vote or register to vote
•	Eligibility requirements of voters to participate in an election, and the qualifications for candidates to run for office
•	Laws, processes, and procedures that govern the organization and implementation of elections and other civic processes, such as referendums, ballot propositions, and censuses
•	Final results or outcome of an election
FYF ineligible
•	Unverified claims about the outcome of an election that is still unfolding and may be false or misleading
Synthetic and Manipulated Media
We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI can make it more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction, carrying both societal and individual risks. Synthetic or manipulated media that shows realistic scenes must be clearly disclosed. This can be done through the use of a sticker or caption, such as ‘synthetic’, ‘fake’, ‘not real’, or ‘altered’.
We balance the expressive value that synthetic media has against the risk of harms to individuals. We do not allow synthetic media that contains the likeness of any real private figure. While we provide more latitude for public figures, we do not want them to be the subject of abuse, or for people to be misled about political or financial issues. We do not allow synthetic media of public figures if the content is used for endorsements or violates any other policy. This includes prohibitions on hate speech, sexual exploitation, and serious forms of harassment (learn more about public figures in Harassment and Bullying).
Synthetic media is content created or modified by AI technology. It includes highly realistic digitally-created (fake) content of real people, such as a video of a real person speaking but their words have been modified or changed.
Realistic scenes include showing fake people, places or events that look like they are real.
Public figures are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, and celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.
NOT allowed
•	Synthetic media showing realistic scenes that are not prominently disclosed or labeled in the video
•	Synthetic media that contains the likeness (visual or audio) of a real person, including: (1) a young person, (2) an adult private figure, and (3) an adult public figure when used for political or commercial endorsements, or if it violates any other policy
•	Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events
Allowed
•	Synthetic media showing a public figure in certain contexts, including artistic and educational content, such as a video showing a celebrity doing a popular TikTok dance, and a historical figure featured in a history lesson
Fake Engagement
Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that others may find interesting. We do not allow the trade of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok’s recommendation system. If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

External Links
Our community members often share links in their profile, bio, or content to connect people to additional content or to other sites. While some links may be helpful or informative, others connect to harmful content that would not be allowed on our platform. Do not post links that direct people to content that would violate our guidelines. If we find a link in violation of our guidelines, it will result in the link being removed or an account ban.
It can be difficult to determine where a Quick Response (QR) code image may lead to and whether the connected content will be safe. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains QR codes unless there is a low risk of harm, such as in the context of e-commerce.
